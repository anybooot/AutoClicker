# ⚡ Core Features
**Smart Click AI:** An advanced algorithmic engine that avoids repetitive patterns by introducing micro-variations in click intervals, perfectly mimicking human behavior.

**Overlay HUD:** A lightning-fast graphical interface that runs over any application with zero frame-rate (FPS) impact.

**Obsidian Encryption:** Your custom configurations are encrypted both locally and in the cloud to prevent unauthorized analysis or data leaks.

**Stealth Engine:** Engineered to operate with a minimal system footprint, staying hidden from standard detection strings.

# 🛠️ Installation Guide
Follow these steps to initialize the protocol:

**1. Download & Extract**
